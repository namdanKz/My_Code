 SYNOPSIS:
   ./loraDirMulBS.py <nodes> <avgsend> <experiment> <simtime> <basestation> [collision]
 DESCRIPTION:
    nodes
        number of nodes to simulate
    avgsend
        average sending interval in milliseconds
    experiment
        experiment is an integer that determines with what radio settings the
        simulation is run. All nodes are configured with a fixed transmit power
        and a single transmit frequency, unless stated otherwise.
        0   use the settings with the the slowest datarate (SF12, BW125, CR4/8).
        1   similair to experiment 0, but use a random choice of 3 transmit
            frequencies.
        2   use the settings with the fastest data rate (SF6, BW500, CR4/5).
        3   optimise the setting per node based on the distance to the gateway.
        4   use the settings as defined in LoRaWAN (SF12, BW125, CR4/5).
        5   similair to experiment 3, but also optimises the transmit power.
    simtime
        total running time in milliseconds
    basestation
        number of base stations to simulate. Can be either 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8 or 24.
    collision
        set to 1 to enable the full collision check, 0 to use a simplified check.
        With the simplified check, two messages collide when they arrive at the
        same time, on the same frequency and spreading factor. The full collision
        check considers the 'capture effect', whereby a collision of one or the
 OUTPUT
    The result of every simulation run will be appended to a file named expX.dat,
    whereby X is the experiment number. The file contains a space separated table
    of values for nodes, collisions, transmissions and total energy spent. The
    data file can be easily plotted using e.g. gnuplot.
